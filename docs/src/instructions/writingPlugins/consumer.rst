Writing consumers
=================

When writing a new consumer it is advisable to have a look at existing consumers.
A good starting point are the Console and File consumers.

Requirements
------------

All consumers have to implement the "core/Consumer" as well as the "core/Plugin" interface.
The most convenient way to do this is to derive from the "core/ConsumerBase" type as it will provide implementations of the most common methods required.
In addition to this, every plugin has to register at the plugin registry to be available as a config option.
This is explained in the general :doc:`plugin section </src/examples/plugins>`.

ConsumerBase
------------

Consumers deriving from "core/ConsumerBase" have to implement the "Consume" method from the "core/Consumer" interface.
In addition to that most plugins might also want to overload the "Configure" function from the "core/Plugin" interface.

The Consume() function will be called as a separate go routine and should do two things.
1. Listen to the control channel
2. Process incoming data

As Consume() is called as a separate go routine you can decide wether to spawn additional go routines to handle both tasks or to let Consume() handle everything.
ConsumerBase gives you two convenience loop functions to handle control commands:

**ControlLoop**
  Will loop until a stop is received and can trigger a callback if a log rotation is requested (SIG_HUP is sent).
  The log rotation callback cane be set e.g. in the Configure method by using the SetRollBack function.
  Other possible callbacks functions are SetPrepareStopCallback and SetStopCallback.

**TickerControlLoop**
  Gives you an additional callback that is triggered in regular intervals.

Both loops only cover control message handling and are blocking calls.
As of their blocking nature you will probably want to spawn a separate go routine handling incoming messages when using these loops.

It is highly recommended to use at least one of these functions in your plugin implementation.
By doing this you can be sure that changes to message streaming and control handling are automatically used by your plugin after a Gollum update.

A typical consume function will look like this:

.. code-block:: go

  func (cons *MyConsumer) Configure(conf core.PluginConfig) error {
	cons.SetStopCallback(cons.close) // Register close to the control message handler
  }

  func (cons *MyConsumer) close() {
    cons.WorkerDone()
  }

  func (cons *MyConsumer) Consume(workers *sync.WaitGroup) {
    cons.AddMainWorker(workers) // New go routine = new worker
    go cons.readData()          // Run until close is called
    cons.ControlLoop()          // Blocks
  }

As we want to run a new go routine we also add a new worker. As this is the first worker we use AddMainWorker().
Additional workers can be added by using AddWorker().
This enables the shutdown routine to wait until all consumers have properly stopped.
However - to avoid a hang during shutdown, make sure that all workers added are properly closed during the shutdown sequence.

After we made sure all workers are registered, the core function readData() is called as a separate go routine.
This is necessary as the ControlLoop will block Consume() until a shutdown is requested.
When a stop control message is received, the StopCallback is executed.
You can use this callback to signal your readData function to stop or you can check the pluginState inside your readData function.
The pluginState will switch to PluginStateStopping after a stop control has been triggered.

Configuration
-------------

If your consumer requires additonal configuration options you should implement the Configure method.
Please refer to the :doc:`Plugin documentation </src/examples/plugins>` for further details.

Sending messages
----------------

Messages can be sent by using either the Enqueue() or EnqueueCopy() method.
Both function will make sure that the message is sent to all streams and the correct stream ID is set.
The function Enqueue() will reference the data you pass to it, while EnqueueCopy() will copy the data to the new message.
The latter will allow you to e.g. safely recycle internal buffers without changing messages that are not processed by all producers, yet.

Both methods expect a sequence number to be passed.
This sequence number is meant to be a runtime unique ID that may allow future checks on duplicate messages.
The most common sequence number is an incrementing 64-bit integer.

.. code-block:: go

  func (cons *MyConsumer) readData() {
    var data []byte
    for cons.IsActive() {
      // ... read data
      cons.Enqueue(data, cons.sequence) // This call may block
      cons.sequence++                   // Increment your sequence number
    }
  }

Writing bare bone consumers
---------------------------

Sometimes it might be useful not to derive from ConsumerBase.
If you decide to go this way please have a look at Gollum's GoDoc API documentation as well as the source of ConsumerBase.
