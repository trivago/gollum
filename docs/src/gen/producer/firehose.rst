Firehose
========

This producer sends data to an AWS Firehose stream.



Parameters
----------

**Firehose**
defines the stream to read from.
By default this is set to "default"


**Region**
defines the amazon region of your firehose stream.
By default this is set to "eu-west-1".


**Endpoint**
defines the amazon endpoint for your firehose stream.
By default this is set to "firehose.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com"


**CredentialType**
defines the credentials that are to be used when
connecting to firehose. This can be one of the following: environment,
static, shared, none.
Static enables the parameters CredentialId, CredentialToken and
CredentialSecret shared enables the parameters CredentialFile and
CredentialProfile. None will not use any credentials and environment
will pull the credentials from environmental settings.
By default this is set to none.


**BatchMaxMessages**
defines the maximum number of messages to send per
batch. By default this is set to 500.


**RecordMaxMessages**
defines the maximum number of messages to join into
a firehose record. By default this is set to 500.


**RecordMessageDelimiter**
defines the string to delimit messages within
a firehose record. By default this is set to "\n".


**SendTimeframeMs**
defines the timeframe in milliseconds in which a second
batch send can be triggered. By default this is set to 1000, i.e. one
send operation per second.


**BatchTimeoutSec**
defines the number of seconds after which a batch is
flushed automatically. By default this is set to 3.


**StreamMapping**
defines a translation from gollum stream to firehose stream
name. If no mapping is given the gollum stream name is used as firehose
stream name.


Parameters (from DirectProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this producer.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
this value will increase shutdown time.


**Streams**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
which means "listen to all routers but the internal".


**FallbackStream**
defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.


**Modulators**
sets formatter and filter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.
