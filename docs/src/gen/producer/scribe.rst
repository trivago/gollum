Scribe
======

/
The scribe producer allows sending messages to Facebook's scribe.




Parameters
----------

**Address**
defines the host and port to connect to.
By default this is set to "localhost:1463".


**ConnectionBufferSizeKB**
sets the connection buffer size in KB. By default this
is set to 1024, i.e. 1 MB buffer.


**BatchMaxCount**
defines the maximum number of messages that can be buffered
before a flush is mandatory. If the buffer is full and a flush is still
underway or cannot be triggered out of other reasons, the producer will
block. By default this is set to 8192.


**BatchFlushCount**
defines the number of messages to be buffered before they are
written to disk. This setting is clamped to BatchMaxCount.
By default this is set to BatchMaxCount / 2.


**BatchTimeoutSec**
defines the maximum number of seconds to wait after the last
message arrived before a batch is flushed automatically. By default this is
set to 5. This also defines the maximum time allowed for messages to be
sent to the server.


**HeartBeatIntervalSec**
defines the interval used to query scribe for status
updates. By default this is set to 5sec.


**Category**
maps a stream to a specific scribe category. You can define the
wildcard stream (*) here, too. When set, all streams that do not have a
specific mapping will go to this category (including _GOLLUM_).
If no category mappings are set the stream name is used.


Parameters (from DirectProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this producer.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
this value will increase shutdown time.


**Streams**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
which means "listen to all routers but the internal".


**FallbackStream**
defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.


**Modulators**
sets formatter and filter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.
