Proxy
=====

This producer is compatible to consumer.proxy.
Responses to messages sent to the given address are sent back to the original
consumer of it is a compatible message source. As with consumer.proxy the
returned messages are partitioned by common message length algorithms.



Parameters
----------

**Address**
stores the identifier to connect to.
This can either be any ip address and port like "localhost:5880" or a file
like "unix:///var/gollum.Proxy". By default this is set to ":5880".


**ConnectionBufferSizeKB**
sets the connection buffer size in KB.
This also defines the size of the buffer used by the message parser.
By default this is set to 1024, i.e. 1 MB buffer.


**TimeoutSec**
defines the maximum time in seconds a client is allowed to take
for a response. By default this is set to 1.


**Partitioner**
defines the algorithm used to read messages from the stream.
The messages will be sent as a whole, no cropping or removal will take place.
By default this is set to "delimiter".

* "delimiter" separates messages by looking for a delimiter string. The
  delimiter is included into the left hand message.

* "ascii" reads an ASCII encoded number at a given offset until a given
  delimiter is found.

* "binary" reads a binary number at a given offset and size

* "binary_le" is an alias for "binary"

* "binary_be" is the same as "binary" but uses big endian encoding

* "fixed" assumes fixed size messages


**Delimiter**
defines the delimiter used by the text and delimiter partitioner.
By default this is set to "\n".


**Offset**
defines the offset used by the binary and text partitioner.
By default this is set to 0. This setting is ignored by the fixed partitioner.


**Size**
defines the size in bytes used by the binary or fixed partitioner.
For binary this can be set to 1,2,4 or 8. By default 4 is chosen.
For fixed this defines the size of a message. By default 1 is chosen.


Parameters (from DirectProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this producer.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
this value will increase shutdown time.


**Streams**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
which means "listen to all routers but the internal".


**FallbackStream**
defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.


**Modulators**
sets formatter and filter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.
