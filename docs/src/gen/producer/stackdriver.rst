Stackdriver
===========

The Stackdriver producer forwards messages to stackdriver logging.
The payload of each message will be passed as log message. This should ideally
be a JSON encoded string.




Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

**ProjectID**

  The google cloud project id storing the logs. This parameter
  is required to be set to a non-empty string.
  
  

**Payload**

  The name of the metadata field to store as payload. This can be a
  string or a subtree, which will be encoded as JSON. If no value is set, the
  message payload will be passed as string.
  By default this is setting is set to "".
  
  

**Severity**

  If set, this denotes a metadata field containing a valid severity
  string. Valid, case sensitive strings are "Default", "Debug", "Info", "Notice",
  "Warning", "Error", "Critical", "Alert" and "Emergency". If a value fails to be
  parsed "Default" is used. If the metadata field is not existing or "" is used,
  the value of DefaultSeverity is used.
  By default this is setting is set to "".
  
  

**DefaultSeverity** (default: Default)

  The severity to use if no severity is set or parsing of the
  Severity metadata field failed. By default this is set to "Default".
  
  

**LogName**

  Defines a mapping between stream name and log name. If not set,
  the stream name will be used as a log name. By default no mapping is set.
  
  

**Labels**

  An array of metadata keys, that should be extracted from each message
  and used as a label. If a key is not available for a single message, the label
  will still be set with an empty string as value.
  By default this is set to an empty array.
  
  

Parameters (from core.BufferedProducer)
---------------------------------------

**Channel**

  This value defines the capacity of the message buffer.
  By default this parameter is set to "8192".
  
  

**ChannelTimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value defines a timeout for each message
  before the message will discarded. To disable the timeout, set this
  parameter to 0.
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
  
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleProducer)
-------------------------------------

**Streams**

  Defines a list of streams the producer will receive from. This
  parameter is mandatory. Specifying "*" causes the producer to receive messages
  from all streams except internal internal ones (e.g. _GOLLUM_).
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**FallbackStream**

  Defines a stream to route messages to if delivery fails.
  The message is reset to its original state before being routed, i.e. all
  modifications done to the message after leaving the consumer are removed.
  Setting this paramater to "" will cause messages to be discared when delivery
  fails.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs** (default: 1000, unit: ms)

  Defines the maximum time in milliseconds a producer is
  allowed to take to shut down. After this timeout the producer is always
  considered to have shut down.  Decreasing this value may lead to lost
  messages during shutdown. Raising it may increase shutdown time.
  
  

**Modulators**

  Defines a list of modulators to be applied to a message when
  it arrives at this producer. If a modulator changes the stream of a message
  the message is NOT routed to this stream anymore.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
