InfluxDB
========


This producer writes data to an influxDB cluster. The data is expected to be
of a valid influxDB format. As the data format changed between influxDB
versions it is advisable to use a formatter for the specific influxDB version
you want to write to. There are collectd to influxDB formatters available
that can be used (as an example).




Parameters
----------

**Host**
defines the host (and port) of the InfluxDB server.
Defaults to "localhost:8086".


**User**
defines the InfluxDB username to use to login. If this name is
left empty credentials are assumed to be disabled. Defaults to empty.


**Password**
defines the user's password. Defaults to empty.


**Database**
sets the InfluxDB database to write to. By default this is
is set to "default".


**TimeBasedName**
enables using time.Format based formatting of databse names.
I.e. you can use something like "metrics-2006-01-02" to switch databases for
each day. This setting is enabled by default.


**RetentionPolicy**
correlates to the InfluxDB retention policy setting.
This is left empty by default (no retention policy used)


**UseVersion08**
has to be set to true when writing data to InfluxDB 0.8.x.
By default this is set to false. DEPRECATED. Use Version instead.


**Version**
defines the InfluxDB version to use as in Mmp (Major, minor, patch).
For version 0.8.x use 80, for version 0.9.0 use 90, for version 1.0.0 use
use 100 and so on. Defaults to 100.


**BatchMaxCount**
defines the maximum number of messages that can be buffered
before a flush is mandatory. If the buffer is full and a flush is still
underway or cannot be triggered out of other reasons, the producer will
block. By default this is set to 8192.


**BatchFlushCount**
defines the number of messages to be buffered before they are
written to InfluxDB. This setting is clamped to BatchMaxCount.
By default this is set to BatchMaxCount / 2.


**BatchTimeoutSec**
defines the maximum number of seconds to wait after the last
message arrived before a batch is flushed automatically. By default this is
set to 5.


Parameters (from BufferedProducer)
----------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this producer.


**Channel**
sets the size of the channel used to communicate messages. By default
this value is set to 8192.


**ChannelTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds for messages to wait if this
producer's queue is full.
A timeout of -1 or lower will send the message the the fallback without notice.
A timeout of 0 will block until the queue is free. This is the default.
A timeout of 1 or higher will wait x milliseconds for the queues to become
available again. If this does not happen, the message will be send to the
retry channel.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
this value will increase shutdown time.


**Router**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
which means "listen to all routers but the internal".


**FallbackStream**
defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.


**Formatter**
sets a formatter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.


**Filter**
sets a filter that is applied before formatting, i.e. before a message
is send to the message queue. If a producer requires filtering after
formatting it has to define a separate filter as the producer decides if
and where to format.


Parameters (from SimpleProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this producer.


**Channel**
sets the size of the channel used to communicate messages. By default
this value is set to 8192.


**ChannelTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds for messages to wait if this
producer's queue is full.
A timeout of -1 or lower will try the fallback route without notice.
A timeout of 0 will block until the queue is free. This is the default.
A timeout of 1 or higher will wait x milliseconds for the queues to become
available again. If this does not happen, the message will be send to the
retry channel.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
this value will increase shutdown time.


**Router**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
which means "listen to all routers but the internal".


**FallbackStream**
defines the stream used for messages that cannot be delivered
e.g. after a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is "".


**Formatter**
sets a formatter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.


**Filter**
sets a filter that is applied before formatting, i.e. before a message
is send to the message queue. If a producer requires filtering after
formatting it has to define a separate filter as the producer decides if
and where to format.
