Socket
======

The socket producer connects to a service over a TCP, UDP or unix domain
socket based connection.

Configuration example

 - "producer.Socket":
   Enable: true
   Address: ":5880"
   ConnectionBufferSizeKB: 1024
   BatchMaxCount: 8192
   BatchFlushCount: 4096
   BatchTimeoutSec: 5
   Acknowledge: ""

Address stores the identifier to connect to.
This can either be any ip address and port like "localhost:5880" or a file
like "unix:///var/gollum.socket". By default this is set to ":5880".

ConnectionBufferSizeKB sets the connection buffer size in KB. By default this
is set to 1024, i.e. 1 MB buffer.

BatchMaxCount defines the maximum number of messages that can be buffered
before a flush is mandatory. If the buffer is full and a flush is still
underway or cannot be triggered out of other reasons, the producer will
block. By default this is set to 8192.

BatchFlushCount defines the number of messages to be buffered before they are
written to disk. This setting is clamped to BatchMaxCount.
By default this is set to BatchMaxCount / 2.

BatchTimeoutSec defines the maximum number of seconds to wait after the last
message arrived before a batch is flushed automatically. By default this is
set to 5.

Acknowledge can be set to a non-empty value to expect the given string as a
response from the server after a batch has been sent.
This setting is disabled by default, i.e. set to "".
If Acknowledge is enabled and a IP-Address is given to Address, TCP is used
to open the connection, otherwise UDP is used.

AckTimeoutMs defines the time in milliseconds to wait for a response from the
server. After this timeout the send is marked as failed. Defaults to 2000.




Parameters
----------

**AckTimeoutMs** (default: 2000, unit: ms)

  (no documentation available)
  

**Acknowledge**

  (no documentation available)
  

**Batch/FlushCount** (default: 4096)

  (no documentation available)
  

**Batch/MaxCount** (default: 8192)

  (no documentation available)
  

**Batch/TimeoutSec** (default: 5, unit: sec)

  (no documentation available)
  

**ConnectionBufferSizeKB** (default: 1024, unit: kb)

  (no documentation available)
  

Parameters (from BufferedProducer)
----------------------------------

**Channel**

  This value defines the capacity of the message buffer.
  By default this parameter is set to "8192".
  
  

**ChannelTimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value defines a timeout for each message before the message will discarded.
  You can set this parameter to "0" for disabling the timeout.
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
  
  

Parameters (from DirectProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**

  switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.
  
  

**FallbackStream**

  defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
  a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.
  
  

**ID**

  allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
  is set to "" which does not register this producer.
  
  

**Modulators**

  sets formatter and filter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
  which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
  Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs**

  sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
  a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
  Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
  this value will increase shutdown time.
  
  

**Streams**

  contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
  message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
  which means "listen to all routers but the internal".
