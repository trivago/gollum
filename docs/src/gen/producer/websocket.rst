Websocket
=========


The websocket producer opens up a websocket.




Parameters
----------

**Address**
defines the host and port to bind to.
This is allowed be any ip address/dns and port like "localhost:5880".
By default this is set to ":81".


**Path**
defines the url path to listen for.
By default this is set to "/"


**ReadTimeoutSec**
specifies the maximum duration in seconds before timing out
read of the request. By default this is set to 3 seconds.


Parameters (from DirectProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this producer.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
this value will increase shutdown time.


**Streams**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
which means "listen to all routers but the internal".


**FallbackStream**
defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.


**Modulators**
sets formatter and filter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.
