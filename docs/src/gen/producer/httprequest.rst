HTTPRequest
===========

The HTTPRequest producer sends messages as HTTP requests to a given webserver.


* If RawData = true, the incoming messages are expected to contain complete
  HTTP requests in "wire format", such as::

    POST /foo/bar HTTP/1.0\n
    Content-type: text/plain\n
    Content-length: 24
    \n
    Dummy test\n
    Request data\n

  In this mode, the message's contents is parsed as an HTTP request and
  sent to the destination server (virtually) unchanged. If the message
  cannot be parsed as an HTTP request, an error is logged. Only the scheme,
  host and port components of the "Address" URL are used; any path and query
  parameters are ignored. The "Encoding" parameter is ignored.


* If RawData = false, a POST request is made to the destination server
  for each incoming message, using the complete URL in "Address". The
  incoming message's contents are delivered in the POST request's body
  and Content-type is set to the value of "Encoding"

Configuration example

 - "producer.HTTPRequest":
   RawData: true
   Encoding: "text/plain; charset=utf-8"
   Address: "http://localhost:80"

Address defines the URL to send http requests to. Set by default
to "http://localhost:80". If the value doesn't contain "://",
it is prepended with "http://", so short forms like "localhost:8088"
are accepted.

RawData chooses how to interpret and relay the incoming data

Encoding defines the payload encoding when RawData is set to false.
Set to "text/plain; charset=utf-8" by default.




Parameters
----------

**Encoding** (default: text/plain; charset=utf-8)

  (no documentation available)
  

**RawData** (default: true)

  (no documentation available)
  

Parameters (from DirectProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**

  switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.
  
  

**FallbackStream**

  defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
  a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.
  
  

**ID**

  allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
  is set to "" which does not register this producer.
  
  

**Modulators**

  sets formatter and filter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
  which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
  Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs**

  sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
  a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
  Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
  this value will increase shutdown time.
  
  

**Streams**

  contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
  message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
  which means "listen to all routers but the internal".
  
  

Parameters (from BufferedProducer)
----------------------------------

**Channel**

  This value defines the capacity of the message buffer.
  By default this parameter is set to "8192".
  
  

**ChannelTimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value defines a timeout for each message before the message will discarded.
  You can set this parameter to "0" for disabling the timeout.
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
