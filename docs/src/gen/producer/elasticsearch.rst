ElasticSearch
=============


The ElasticSearch producer sends messages to elastic search using the bulk
http API.




Parameters
----------

**RetrySec**
denotes the time in seconds after which a failed dataset will be
transmitted again. By default this is set to 5.


**Connections**
defines the number of simultaneous connections allowed to a
elasticsearch server. This is set to 6 by default.


**TTL**
defines the TTL set in elasticsearch messages. By default this is set to
"" which means no TTL.


**DayBasedIndex**
can be set to true to append the date of the message to the
index as in "<index>_YYYY-MM-DD". By default this is set to false.


**Servers**
defines a list of servers to connect to. The first server in the list
is used as the server passed to the "Domain" setting. The Domain setting can
be overwritten, too.


**Port**
defines the elasticsearch port, which has to be the same for all servers.
By default this is set to 9200.


**User**
and Password can be used to pass credentials to the elasticsearch server.
By default both settings are empty.


**Index**
maps a stream to a specific index. You can define the
wildcard stream (*) here, too. If set all streams that do not have a specific
mapping will go to this stream (including _GOLLUM_).
If no category mappings are set the stream name is used.


**Type**
maps a stream to a specific type. This behaves like the index map and
is used to assign a _type to an elasticsearch message. By default the type
"log" is used.


**DataTypes**
allows to define elasticsearch type mappings for indexes that are
being created by this producer (e.g. day based indexes). You can define
mappings per index.


**Settings**
allows to define elasticsearch index settings for indexes that are
being created by this producer (e.g. day based indexes). You can define
settings per index.


**BatchSizeByte**
defines the size in bytes required to trigger a flush.
By default this is set to 32768 (32KB).


**BatchMaxCount**
defines the number of documents required to trigger a flush.
By default this is set to 256.


**BatchTimeoutSec**
defines the time in seconds after which a flush will be
triggered. By default this is set to 5.


Parameters (from DirectProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this producer.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
this value will increase shutdown time.


**Streams**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
which means "listen to all routers but the internal".


**FallbackStream**
defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.


**Modulators**
sets formatter and filter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.
