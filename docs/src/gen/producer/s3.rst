S3
==

This producer sends data to an AWS S3 Bucket.



Parameters
----------

**Region**
defines the amazon region of your s3 bucket.
By default this is set to "eu-west-1".


**Endpoint**
defines the amazon endpoint for your s3 bucket.
By default this is set to "s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com"


**StorageClass**
defines the amazon s3 storage class for objects created, from
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html
By default this is set to "STANDARD".


**CredentialType**
defines the credentials that are to be used when
connecting to s3. This can be one of the following: environment,
static, shared, none.
Static enables the parameters CredentialId, CredentialToken and
CredentialSecret shared enables the parameters CredentialFile and
CredentialProfile. None will not use any credentials and environment
will pull the credentials from environmental settings.
By default this is set to none.


**BatchMaxMessages**
defines the maximum number of messages to upload per
batch. By default this is set to 5000.


**ObjectMaxMessages**
defines the maximum number of messages to join into
an s3 object. By default this is set to 5000.


**ObjectMessageDelimiter**
defines the string to delimit messages within
an s3 object. By default this is set to "\n".


**SendTimeframeMs**
defines the timeframe in milliseconds in which a second
batch send can be triggered. By default this is set to 10000, i.e. ten
upload operations per second per s3 path.


**BatchTimeoutSec**
defines the number of seconds after which a batch is
flushed automatically. By default this is set to 30.


**TimestampWrite**
defines the go timestamp format that will be used in naming
objects. Objects are named <s3_path><timestamp><sha1>. By default timestamp
is set to "2006-01-02T15:04:05".


**PathFormatter**
can define a formatter that extracts the path suffix for an s3
object from the object data. By default this is uses the sha1 of the object.
A good formatter for this can be format.Identifier.


**Compress**
defines whether to gzip compress the object before uploading.
This adds a ".gz" extension to objects. By default this is set to false.


**LocalPath**
defines the local output directory for temporary object files.
Files will be stored as "<path>/<number>". Compressed files will have a .gz
extension. State will be stored in "<path>/state". By default this is
not set, and objects will be built in memory.


**UploadOnShutdown**
defines whether to upload all temporary object files on
shutdown. This has no effect if LocalPath is not set. By default this is false.


**FileMaxAgeSec**
defines the maximum age of a local file before it is uploaded.
This defaults to 3600 (1 hour).


**FileMaxMB**
defines the maximum size of a local file before it is uploaded.
This limit is imposed before compression occurs. This defaults to 1000 (1 GB).


**StreamMapping**
defines a translation from gollum stream to s3 bucket/path. If
no mapping is given the gollum stream name is used as s3 bucket.
Values are of the form bucket/path or bucket, s3:// prefix is not allowed.
The full path of the object will be s3://<StreamMapping><Timestamp><PathFormat>
where Timestamp is time the object is written formatted with TimestampWrite,
and PathFormat is the output of PathFormatter when passed the object data.


Parameters (from SimpleProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this producer.


**Channel**
sets the size of the channel used to communicate messages. By default
this value is set to 8192.


**ChannelTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds for messages to wait if this
producer's queue is full.
A timeout of -1 or lower will try the fallback route without notice.
A timeout of 0 will block until the queue is free. This is the default.
A timeout of 1 or higher will wait x milliseconds for the queues to become
available again. If this does not happen, the message will be send to the
retry channel.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
this value will increase shutdown time.


**Router**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
which means "listen to all routers but the internal".


**FallbackStream**
defines the stream used for messages that cannot be delivered
e.g. after a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is "".


**Formatter**
sets a formatter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.


**Filter**
sets a filter that is applied before formatting, i.e. before a message
is send to the message queue. If a producer requires filtering after
formatting it has to define a separate filter as the producer decides if
and where to format.
