Redis
=====

This producer sends data to a redis server. Different redis storage types
and database indexes are supported. This producer does not implement support
for redis 3.0 cluster.



Parameters
----------

**Address**
stores the identifier to connect to.
This can either be any ip address and port like "localhost:6379" or a file
like "unix:///var/redis.socket". By default this is set to ":6379".


**Database**
defines the redis database to connect to.
By default this is set to 0.


**Key**
defines the redis key to store the values in.
This field is ignored when "KeyFormatter" is set.
By default this is set to "default".


**Storage**
defines the type of the storage to use. Valid values are: "hash",
"list", "set", "sortedset", "string". By default this is set to "hash".


**FieldFormatter**
defines an extra formatter used to define an additional field or
score value if required by the storage type. If no field value is required
this value is ignored. By default this is set to "format.Identifier".


**FieldAfterFormat**
will send the formatted message to the FieldFormatter if set
to true. If this is set to false the message will be send to the FieldFormatter
before it has been formatted. By default this is set to false.


**KeyFormatter**
defines an extra formatter used to allow generating the key from
a message. If this value is set the "Key" field will be ignored. By default
this field is not used.


**KeyAfterFormat**
will send the formatted message to the keyFormatter if set
to true. If this is set to false the message will be send to the keyFormatter
before it has been formatted. By default this is set to false.


Parameters (from DirectProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this producer.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
this value will increase shutdown time.


**Streams**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
which means "listen to all routers but the internal".


**FallbackStream**
defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.


**Modulators**
sets formatter and filter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.
