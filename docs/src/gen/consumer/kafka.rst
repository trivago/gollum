Kafka
=====


Thes consumer reads data from a given kafka topic. It is based on the sarama
library so most settings are mapped to the settings from this library.




Parameters
----------

**Topic**
defines the kafka topic to read from. By default this is set to "default".


**ClientId**
sets the client id of this consumer. By default this is "gollum".


**GroupId**
sets the consumer group of this consumer. By default this is "" which
disables consumer groups. This requires Version to be >= 0.9.


**Version**
defines the kafka protocol version to use. Common values are 0.8.2,
0.9.0 or 0.10.0. Values of the form "A.B" are allowed as well as "A.B.C"
and "A.B.C.D". Defaults to "0.8.2", or if GroupId is set "0.9.0.1". If the
version given is not known, the closest possible version is chosen. If GroupId
is set and this is < "0.9", "0.9.0.1" will be used.


**DefaultOffset**
defines where to start reading the topic. Valid values are
"oldest" and "newest". If OffsetFile is defined the DefaultOffset setting
will be ignored unless the file does not exist.
By default this is set to "newest". Ignored when using GroupId.


**OffsetFile**
defines the path to a file that stores the current offset inside
a given partition. If the consumer is restarted that offset is used to continue
reading. By default this is set to "" which disables the offset file. Ignored
when using GroupId.


**FolderPermissions**
is used to create the offset file path if necessary.
Set to 0755 by default. Ignored when using GroupId.


**Ordered**
can be set to enforce partitions to be read one-by-one in a round robin
fashion instead of reading in parallel from all partitions.
Set to false by default. Ignored when using GroupId.


**MaxOpenRequests**
defines the number of simultaneous connections are allowed.
By default this is set to 5.


**ServerTimeoutSec**
defines the time after which a connection is set to timed
out. By default this is set to 30 seconds.


**MaxFetchSizeByte**
sets the maximum size of a message to fetch. Larger messages
will be ignored. By default this is set to 0 (fetch all messages).


**MinFetchSizeByte**
defines the minimum amout of data to fetch from Kafka per
request. If less data is available the broker will wait. By default this is
set to 1.


**FetchTimeoutMs**
defines the time in milliseconds the broker will wait for
MinFetchSizeByte to be reached before processing data anyway. By default this
is set to 250ms.


**MessageBufferCount**
sets the internal channel size for the kafka client.
By default this is set to 8192.


**PresistTimoutMs**
defines the time in milliseconds between writes to OffsetFile.
By default this is set to 5000. Shorter durations reduce the amount of
duplicate messages after a fail but increases I/O. When using GroupId this
only controls how long to pause after receiving errors.


**ElectRetries**
defines how many times to retry during a leader election.
By default this is set to 3.


**ElectTimeoutMs**
defines the number of milliseconds to wait for the cluster to
elect a new leader. Defaults to 250.


**MetadataRefreshMs**
set the interval in seconds for fetching cluster metadata.
By default this is set to 10000. This corresponds to the JVM setting
`topic.metadata.refresh.interval.ms`.


**TlsEnable**
defines whether to use TLS to communicate with brokers. Defaults
to false.


**TlsKeyLocation**
defines the path to the client's private key (PEM) for used
for authentication. Defaults to "".


**TlsCertificateLocation**
defines the path to the client's public key (PEM) used
for authentication. Defaults to "".


**TlsCaLocation**
defines the path to CA certificate(s) for verifying the broker's
key. Defaults to "".


**TlsServerName**
is used to verify the hostname on the server's certificate
unless TlsInsecureSkipVerify is true. Defaults to "".


**TlsInsecureSkipVerify**
controls whether to verify the server's certificate
chain and host name. Defaults to false.


**SaslEnable**
is whether to use SASL for authentication. Defaults to false.


**SaslUsername**
is the user for SASL/PLAIN authentication. Defaults to "gollum".


**SaslPassword**
is the password for SASL/PLAIN authentication. Defaults to "".


**Servers**
contains the list of all kafka servers to connect to. By default this
is set to contain only "localhost:9092".


Parameters (from SimpleConsumer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this consumer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this consumer.


**Router**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this consumer will produce. By default this is set to "*"
which means only producers set to consume "all routers" will get these
messages.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
various timeouts during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
