Console
=======


This consumer reads from stdin. A message is generated after each newline
character.




Parameters
----------

**Console**
defines the pipe to read from. This can be "stdin" or the name
of a named pipe that is created if not existing. The default is "stdin"


**Permissions**
accepts an octal number string that contains the unix file
permissions used when creating a named pipe.
By default this is set to "0664".


**ExitOnEOF**
can be set to true to trigger an exit signal if StdIn is closed
(e.g. when a pipe is closed). This is set to false by default.


Parameters (from SimpleConsumer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this consumer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this consumer.


**Streams**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this consumer will produce. By default this is set to "*"
which means only producers set to consume "all streams" will get these
messages.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
various timeouts during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
