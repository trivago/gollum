Socket
======


The socket consumer reads messages directly as-is from a given socket.
Messages are separated from the stream by using a specific partitioner method.




Parameters
----------

**Address**
defines the protocol, host and port or socket to bind to.
This can either be any ip address and port like "localhost:5880" or a file
like "unix:///var/gollum.socket". By default this is set to ":5880".


**Permissions**
sets the file permissions for "unix://" based connections as an
four digit octal number string. By default this is set to "0770".


**Acknowledge**
can be set to a non-empty value to inform the writer on success
or error. On success the given string is send. Any error will close the
connection. This setting is disabled by default, i.e. set to "".
If Acknowledge is enabled and a IP-Address is given to Address, TCP is
used to open the connection, otherwise UDP is used.
If an error occurs during write "NOT <Acknowledge>" is returned.


**Partitioner**
defines the algorithm used to read messages from the router.
By default this is set to "delimiter".

* "delimiter" separates messages by looking for a delimiter string.
  The delimiter is removed from the message.

* "ascii" reads an ASCII number at a given offset until a given delimiter is found.
  Everything to the right of and including the delimiter is removed from the message.

* "binary" reads a binary number at a given offset and size.

* "binary_le" is an alias for "binary".

* "binary_be" is the same as "binary" but uses big endian encoding.

* "fixed" assumes fixed size messages.


**Delimiter**
defines the delimiter used by the text and delimiter partitioner.
By default this is set to "\n".


**Offset**
defines the offset used by the binary and text partitioner.
By default this is set to 0. This setting is ignored by the fixed partitioner.


**Size**
defines the size in bytes used by the binary or fixed partitioner.
For binary this can be set to 1,2,4 or 8. By default 4 is chosen.
For fixed this defines the size of a message. By default 1 is chosen.


**ReconnectAfterSec**
defines the number of seconds to wait before a connection
is tried to be reopened again. By default this is set to 2.


**AckTimoutSec**
defines the number of seconds waited for an acknowledge to
succeed. Set to 2 by default.


**ReadTimoutSec**
defines the number of seconds that waited for data to be
received. Set to 5 by default.


**RemoveOldSocket**
toggles removing exisiting files with the same name as the
socket (unix://<path>) prior to connecting. Enabled by default.


Parameters (from SimpleConsumer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this consumer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this consumer.


**Router**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this consumer will produce. By default this is set to "*"
which means only producers set to consume "all routers" will get these
messages.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
various timeouts during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
