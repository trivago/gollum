Syslogd
=======


The syslogd consumer accepts messages from a syslogd compatible socket.




Parameters
----------

**Address**
defines the protocol, host and port or socket to bind to.
This can either be any ip address and port like "localhost:5880" or a file
like "unix:///var/gollum.socket". By default this is set to "udp://0.0.0.0:514".
The protocol can be defined along with the address, e.g. "tcp://..." but
this may be ignored if a certain protocol format does not support the desired
transport protocol.


**Format**
defines the syslog standard to expect for message encoding.
Three standards are currently supported, by default this is set to "RFC6587".

* RFC3164 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164) udp only.

* RFC5424 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424) udp only.

* RFC6587 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6587) tcp or udp.


Parameters (from SimpleConsumer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this consumer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this consumer.


**Streams**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this consumer will produce. By default this is set to "*"
which means only producers set to consume "all streams" will get these
messages.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
various timeouts during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
