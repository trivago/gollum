HTTP
====


This consumer opens up an HTTP 1.1 server and processes the contents of any
incoming HTTP request.




Parameters
----------

**Address**
stores the host and port to bind to.
This is allowed be any ip address/dns and port like "localhost:5880".
By default this is set to ":80".


**ReadTimeoutSec**
specifies the maximum duration in seconds before timing out
the HTTP read request. By default this is set to 3 seconds.


**WithHeaders**
can be set to false to only read the HTTP body instead of passing
the whole HTTP message. By default this setting is set to true.


**Htpasswd**
can be set to the htpasswd formatted file to enable HTTP BasicAuth


**BasicRealm**
can be set for HTTP BasicAuth


**Certificate**
defines a path to a root certificate file to make this consumer
handle HTTPS connections. Left empty by default (disabled).
If a Certificate is given, a PrivateKey must be given, too.


**PrivateKey**
defines a path to the private key used for HTTPS connections.
Left empty by default (disabled).
If a Certificate is given, a PrivatKey must be given, too.


Parameters (from SimpleConsumer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this consumer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this consumer.


**Streams**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this consumer will produce. By default this is set to "*"
which means only producers set to consume "all streams" will get these
messages.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
various timeouts during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
