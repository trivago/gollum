Http
====================================================================

 This consumer opens up an HTTP 1.1 server and processes the contents of any incoming HTTP request.


Parameters
----------

**Address**
  Address stores the host and port to bind to.
  This is allowed be any ip address/dns and port like "localhost:5880".
  By default this is set to ":80".

**ReadTimeoutSec**
  ReadTimeoutSec specifies the maximum duration in seconds before timing out the HTTP read request.
  By default this is set to 3 seconds.

**WithHeaders**
  WithHeaders can be set to false to only read the HTTP body instead of passing the whole HTTP message.
  By default this setting is set to true.

**Htpasswd**
  Htpasswd can be set to the htpasswd formatted file to enable HTTP BasicAuth.

**BasicRealm**
  BasicRealm can be set for HTTP BasicAuth.

**Certificate**
  Certificate defines a path to a root certificate file to make this consumer handle HTTPS connections.
  Left empty by default (disabled).
  If a Certificate is given, a PrivateKey must be given, too.

**PrivateKey**
  PrivateKey defines a path to the private key used for HTTPS connections.
  Left empty by default (disabled).
  If a Certificate is given, a PrivatKey must be given, too.

Parameters (from SimpleConsumer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
  Enable switches the consumer on or off.
  By default this value is set to true.

**ID**
  ID allows this consumer to be found by other plugins by name.
  By default this is set to "" which does not register this consumer.

**Router**
  Router contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the message channels this consumer will produce.
  By default this is set to "*" which means only producers set to consume "all routers" will get these messages.

**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
  ShutdownTimeoutMs sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect various timeouts during shutdown.
  By default this is set to 1 second.
