Profiler
========


The "Profiler" consumer plugin autogenerates messages in user-defined quantity,
size and density. It can be used to profile producers and configurations and to
provide a message source for testing.

Before startup, [TemplateCount] template payloads are generated based on the
format specifier [Message], using characters from [Characters]. The length of
each template is determined by format size specifier(s) in [Message].

During execution, [Batches] batches of [Runs] messages are generated, with a
[DelayMs] ms delay between each message. Each message's payload is randomly
selected from the set of template payloads above.




Parameters
----------

**Runs**
defines the number of messages per batch. By default this is set to
10000.


**Batches**
defines the number of measurement runs to do. By default this is set
to 10.


**TemplateCount**
defines the number of message templates to be generated.
A random message template will be chosen when a message is sent. Templates
are generated in advance. By default this is set to 10.


**Characters**
defines the characters to be used in generated strings. By default
these are "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ01234567890 ".


**Message**
defines a go format string to be used to generate the message templates.
The length of the values generated will be deduced from the format size
parameter. I.e. "%200d" will generate a digit between 0 and 200, "%10s" will
generate a string with 10 characters, etc..
By default this is set to "%256s".


**DelayMs**
defines the number of milliseconds of sleep between messages.
By default this is set to 0.


**KeepRunning**
can be set to `true` to disable automatic shutdown of gollum after
profiling is done. This can be used to e.g. read metrics after a profile run.
By default this is set to `false`.


Parameters (from SimpleConsumer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this consumer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this consumer.


**Streams**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this consumer will produce. By default this is set to "*"
which means only producers set to consume "all streams" will get these
messages.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
various timeouts during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.


Example
-------

.. code-block:: yaml

	# Generate 10 x 10000 messages of 256 bytes
	MyProfiler:
	  Type: "consumer.Profiler"
	  Runs: 10000
	  Batches: 10
	  TemplateCount: 10
	  Characters: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ01234567890"
	  Message: "%256s"
		 DelayMs: 0
	  KeepRunning: false
	# Generate a short message every 0.5s, useful for testing and debugging
	JunkGenerator:
	  Type: "consumer.Profiler"
	  Message: "%20s"
	  Streams: "junkstream"
	  Characters: "abcdefghijklmZ"
	  KeepRunning: true
	  Runs: 10000
	  Batches: 3000000
	  DelayMs: 500
