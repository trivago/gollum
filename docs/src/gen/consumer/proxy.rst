Proxy
=====


The proxy consumer reads messages directly as-is from a given socket.
Messages are extracted by standard message size algorithms (see Partitioner).
This consumer can be used with any compatible proxy producer to establish
a two-way communication.




Parameters
----------

**Address**
defines the protocol, host and port or socket to bind to.
This can either be any ip address and port like "localhost:5880" or a file
like "unix:///var/gollum.socket". By default this is set to ":5880".
UDP is not supported.


**Partitioner**
defines the algorithm used to read messages from the router.
The messages will be sent as a whole, no cropping or removal will take place.
By default this is set to "delimiter".

* "delimiter" separates messages by looking for a delimiter string.
  The delimiter is included into the left hand message.

* "ascii" reads an ASCII number at a given offset until a given delimiter is found.
  Everything to the right of and including the delimiter is removed from the message.

* "binary" reads a binary number at a given offset and size.

* "binary_le" is an alias for "binary".

* "binary_be" is the same as "binary" but uses big endian encoding.

* "fixed" assumes fixed size messages.


**Delimiter**
defines the delimiter used by the text and delimiter partitioner.
By default this is set to "\n".


**Offset**
defines the offset used by the binary and text partitioner.
By default this is set to 0. This setting is ignored by the fixed partitioner.


**Size**
defines the size in bytes used by the binary or fixed partitioner.
For binary this can be set to 1,2,4 or 8. By default 4 is chosen.
For fixed this defines the size of a message. By default 1 is chosen.


Parameters (from SimpleConsumer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this consumer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this consumer.


**Streams**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this consumer will produce. By default this is set to "*"
which means only producers set to consume "all streams" will get these
messages.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
various timeouts during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.


Example
-------

.. code-block:: yaml

	 - "consumer.Proxy":
	   Address: ":5880"
	   Partitioner: "delimiter"
	   Delimiter: "\n"
	   Offset: 0
	   Size: 1
