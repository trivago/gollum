File
====


The file consumer allows to read from files while looking for a delimiter
that marks the end of a message. If the file is part of e.g. a log rotation
the file consumer can be set to a symbolic link of the latest file and
(optionally) be told to reopen the file by sending a SIGHUP. A symlink to
a file will automatically be reopened if the underlying file is changed.




Parameters
----------

**File**
is a mandatory setting and contains the file to read. The file will be
read from beginning to end and the reader will stay attached until the
consumer is stopped. I.e. appends to the attached file will be recognized
automatically.


**DefaultOffset**
defines where to start reading the file. Valid values are
"oldest" and "newest". If OffsetFile is defined the DefaultOffset setting
will be ignored unless the file does not exist.
By default this is set to "newest".


**OffsetFile**
defines the path to a file that stores the current offset inside
the given file. If the consumer is restarted that offset is used to continue
reading. By default this is set to "" which disables the offset file.


**Delimiter**
defines the end of a message inside the file. By default this is
set to "\n".


Parameters (from SimpleConsumer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this consumer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this consumer.


**Streams**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this consumer will produce. By default this is set to "*"
which means only producers set to consume "all streams" will get these
messages.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
various timeouts during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.


Example
-------

.. code-block:: yaml

	 - "consumer.File":
	   File: "/var/run/system.log"
	   DefaultOffset: "Newest"
	   OffsetFile: ""
	   Delimiter: "\n"
