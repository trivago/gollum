File
====

The File consumer reads messages from a file, looking for a customizable
delimiter sequence that marks the end of a message. If the file is part of
e.g. a log rotation, the consumer can be set to read from a symbolic link
pointing to the current file and (optionally) be told to reopen the file
by sending a SIGHUP. A symlink to a file will automatically be reopened
if the underlying file is changed.




Metadata
--------

*NOTE: The metadata will only set if the parameter `SetMetadata` is active.*


**file**

  The file name of the consumed file (set)
  
  

**dir**

  The directory of the consumed file (set)
  
  

Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

**File**

  This value is a mandatory setting and contains the name of the
  file to read. This field supports glob patterns.
  If the file pointed to is a symlink, changes to the symlink will be
  detected. The file will be watched for changes, so active logfiles can
  be scraped, too.
  
  

**OffsetFilePath**

  This value defines a path where the individual, current
  file offsets are stored. The filename will the name and extension of the
  source file plus the extension ".offset". If the consumer is restarted,
  these offset files are used to continue reading from the previous position.
  To disable this setting, set it to "".
  By default this parameter is set to "".
  
  

**Delimiter** (default: \n)

  This value defines the delimiter sequence to expect at the
  end of each message in the file.
  By default this parameter is set to "\n".
  
  

**ObserveMode** (default: poll)

  This value select how the source file is observed. Available
  values are `poll` and `watch`.  NOTE: The watch implementation uses
  the [fsnotify/fsnotify](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify) package.
  If your source file is rotated (moved or removed), please verify that
  your file system and distribution support the `RENAME` and `REMOVE` events;
  the consumer's stability depends on them.
  By default this parameter is set to `poll`.
  
  

**DefaultOffset** (default: newest)

  This value defines the default offset from which to start
  reading within the file. Valid values are  "oldest" and "newest". If OffsetFile
  is defined and the file exists, the DefaultOffset parameter is ignored.
  By default this parameter is set to "newest".
  
  

**PollingDelayMs** (default: 100, unit: ms)

  This value defines the duration in milliseconds the consumer
  waits between checking the source file for new content after hitting the
  end of file (EOF). NOTE: This settings only takes effect if the consumer is
  running in `poll` mode!
  By default this parameter is set to "100".
  
  

**RetryDelaySec** (default: 3, unit: s)

  This value defines the duration in seconds the consumer waits
  between retries, e.g. after not being able to open a file.
  By default this parameter is set to "3".
  
  

**DirScanIntervalSec** (default: 10, unit: s)

  Only applies when using globs. This setting will define the
  interval in secnds in which the glob will be re-evaluated and new files can be
  scraped. By default this parameter is set to "10".
  
  

**SetMetadata** (default: false)

  When this value is set to "true", the fields mentioned in the metadata
  section will be added to each message. Adding metadata will have a
  performance impact on systems with high throughput.
  By default this parameter is set to "false".
  
  

**BlackList**

  A regular expression matching file paths to NOT read. When both
  BlackList and WhiteList are defined, the WhiteList takes precedence.
  This setting is only used when glob expressions (*, ?) are present in the
  filename. The path checked is the one before symlink evaluation.
  By default this parameter is set to "".
  
  

**WhiteList**

  A regular expression matching file paths to read. When both
  BlackList and WhiteList are defined, the WhiteList takes precedence.
  This setting is only used when glob expressions (*, ?) are present in the
  filename. The path checked is the one before symlink evaluation.
  By default this parameter is set to "".
  
  

**Files** (default: /var/log/*.log)

  (no documentation available)
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleConsumer)
-------------------------------------

**Streams**

  Defines a list of streams a consumer will send to. This parameter
  is mandatory. When using "*" messages will be sent only to the internal "*"
  stream. It will NOT send messages to all streams.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs** (default: 1000, unit: ms)

  Defines the maximum time in milliseconds a consumer is
  allowed to take to shut down. After this timeout the consumer is always
  considered to have shut down.
  By default this parameter is set to 1000.
  
  

**Modulators**

  Defines a list of modulators to be applied to a message before
  it is sent to the list of streams. If a modulator specifies a stream, the
  message is only sent to that specific stream. A message is saved as original
  after all modulators have been applied.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**ModulatorRoutines**

  Defines the number of go routines reserved for
  modulating messages. Setting this parameter to 0 will use as many go routines
  as the specific consumer plugin is using for fetching data. Any other value
  will force the given number fo go routines to be used.
  By default this parameter is set to 0
  
  

**ModulatorQueueSize**

  Defines the size of the channel used to buffer messages
  before they are fetched by the next free modulator go routine. If the
  ModulatorRoutines parameter is set to 0 this parameter is ignored.
  By default this parameter is set to 1024.
  
  

Examples
--------

This example will read all the `.log` files `/var/log/` into one stream and
create a message for each new entry. If the file starts with `sys` it is ignored
