RoundRobin
==========


Messages will be sent to one of the producers attached to this router.
Producers will be switched one-by-one.

The "RoundRobin" router relays each message sent to the stream [Stream] to
exactly one of the producers connected to [Stream]. The producer is selected
by rotating the connected producers in sequence, one producer per received
message.

**Stream**
Specifies the name of the stream this plugin is supposed to
read messages from.


**Filters**
A list of zero or more Filter plugins to connect to this router.
