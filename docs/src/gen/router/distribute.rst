Distribute
==========

The "Distribute" plugin provides 1:n stream remapping by duplicating
messages.

During startup, it creates a set of streams with names listed
in [TargetStreams]. During execution, it consumes messages from
the stream [Stream] and enqueues copies of these messages onto
each of the streams listed in [TargetStreams].

When routing to multiple routers, the incoming stream has to be listed
explicitly to be used.

Configuration example:

# Generate junk
JunkGenerator:
  Type: "consumer.Profiler"
  Message: "%20s"
  Streams: "junkstream"
  Characters: "abcdefghijklmZ"
  KeepRunning: true
  Runs: 10000
  Batches: 3000000
  DelayMs: 500
# Filter messages and distribute them to 2 new streams
JunkRouterDist:
  Type: "router.Distribute"
  Stream: "junkstream"
  TargetStreams:
    - "junkdist_00"
    - "junkdist_01"
  Filters:
    - JunkRegexp:
        Type: "filter.RegExp"
        Expression: "Z"
# Print messages from junkdist_00
JunkDistPrinter00:
  Type: "producer.Console"
  Streams: "junkdist_00"
  Modulators:
    - "format.Envelope":
        Prefix: "[junk_00] "
# Print messages from junkdist_01
JunkDistPrinter01:
  Type: "producer.Console"
  Streams: "junkdist_01"
  Modulators:
    - "format.Envelope":
        Prefix: "[junk_01] "

TargetStreams Specifies names of the streams to create.




Parameters (from SimpleRouter)
------------------------------

**Filters**

  A optional list of zero or more Filter plugins to connect to this router.
  
  

**Stream**

  This value specifies the name of the stream this plugin is supposed to
  read messages from.
  
  

**TimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value set a timeout in milliseconds until a message should handled by the router.
  You can disable this behavior by setting "0".
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
