Distribute
==========


The "Distribute" plugin provides 1:n stream remapping by duplicating
messages.

During startup, it creates a set of streams with names listed
in [TargetStreams]. During execution, it consumes messages from
the stream [Stream] and enqueues copies of these messages onto
each of the streams listed in [TargetStreams].

When routing to multiple routers, the incoming stream has to be listed
explicitly to be used.




Parameters
----------

**TargetStreams**
Specifies names of the streams to create.


Parameters (from SimpleRouter)
------------------------------

**Stream**
Specifies the name of the stream this plugin is supposed to
read messages from.


**Filters**
A list of zero or more Filter plugins to connect to this router.


**TimeoutMs**
... (default: 0, metric: ms)
