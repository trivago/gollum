TextToJSON
==========

TextToJSON is a formatter that passes a message encapsulated as JSON in the form
{"message":"..."}. The actual message is formatted by a nested formatter and
HTML escaped.

Configuration example

 - format.JSON:
     StartState: "findKey"
     Directives:
	    - 'findKey :":  key     ::'
	    - 'findKey :}:          : pop  : end'
	    - 'key     :":  findVal :      : key'
	    - 'findVal :\:: value   ::'
     ApplyTo: "payload" # payload or <metaKey>

StartState defines the initial parser state when parsing a message.
By default this is set to "" which will fall back to the first state used in
the JSONDirectives array.

TimestampRead defines the go timestamp format expected from fields that
are parsed as "dat". When JSONUnixTimestampRead is not set, this is set to
"20060102150405" by default.

UnixTimestampRead defines the unix timestamp format expected from fields that
are parsed as "dat". May be "s", "ms", or "ns", and only accepts integer values.
When JSONTimestampRead is set, this is ignored.

TimestampWrite defines the go timestamp format that "dat" fields will be
converted to. By default this is set to "2006-01-02 15:04:05 MST".

ApplyTo defines the formatter content to use

Directives defines an array of parser directives.
This setting is mandatory and has no default value.
Each string must be of the following format: "State:Token:NextState:Flags:Function".
Spaces will be stripped from all fields but Token. If a fields requires a
colon it has to be escaped with a backslash. Other escape characters
supported are \n, \r and \t.
Flags (Directives) can be a comma separated set of the following flags.

* continue -> Prepend the token to the next match.

* append   -> Append the token to the current match and continue reading.

* include  -> Append the token to the current match.

* push     -> Push the current state to the stack.

* pop      -> Pop the stack and use the returned state if possible.

Function (Directives) can hold one of the following names.

* key     -> Write the current match as a key.

* val     -> Write the current match as a value without quotes.

* esc     -> Write the current match as a escaped string value.

* dat     -> Write the current match as a timestamp value.

* arr     -> Start a new array.

* obj     -> Start a new object.

* end     -> Close an array or object.

* arr+val -> arr followed by val.

* arr+esc -> arr followed by esc.

* arr+dat -> arr followed by dat.

* val+end -> val followed by end.

* esc+end -> esc followed by end.

* dat+end -> dat followed by end.

Rules for storage (Directives):

* if a value is written without a previous key write, a key will be auto
  generated from the current parser state name. This does not happen when
  inside an array.

* If key is written without a previous value write, a null value will be
  written. This does not happen after an object has been started.

* A key write inside an array will cause the array to be closed. If the array
  is nested, all arrays will be closed.
