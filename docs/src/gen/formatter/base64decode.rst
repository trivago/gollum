Base64Decode
============

Base64Decode is a formatter that decodes a base64 message.
If a message is not or only partly base64 encoded an error will be logged
and the decoded part is returned. RFC 4648 is expected.



Parameters
----------

**Base64Dictionary**
defines the 64-character base64 lookup dictionary to use. When
left empty a dictionary as defined by RFC4648 is used. This is the default.


**Base64DataFormatter**
defines a formatter that is applied before the base64
decoding takes place. By default this is set to "format.Forward"


Example
-------

.. code-block:: yaml

	 - format.Base64Decode:
	     Dictionary: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890+/"
	     ApplyTo: "payload" # payload or <metaKey>
