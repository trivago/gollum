# Gollum changelog

## 0.6.0

Gollum 0.6.0 contains breaking changes over version 0.5.x.
Please read the release notes carefully

### New with 0.6.0

 * Consumer.File setting "Files" now supports glob patterns.
 * Consumer.Syslog now allows non-standard protocol types (see issue #234)

### Breaking changes with 0.6.0

 * Metrics are now collected using go-metrics. This allows e.g. prometheus output (default).
   Old-style metrics have been removed and many metrics names have changed.
 * Consumer.File setting "File" has been renamed to "Files"
 * Consumer.File setting "OffsetFile" changed to "OffsetPath" to support multiple offset files per consumer.
 * Consumer.File setting "PollingDelay" has been renamed to "PollingDelayMs".
 * Removed support for go 1.8 in order to allow sync.Map
