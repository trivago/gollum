# What is Gollum?

Gollum is an **n:m multiplexer** that gathers messages from different sources and broadcasts them to a set of destinations.

Gollum originally started as a tool to **MUL**-tiplex **LOG**-files (read it backwards to get the name).
It quickly evolved to a one-way router for all kinds of messages, not limited to just logs.
Gollum is written in Go to make it scalable and easy to extend without the need to use a scripting language.
